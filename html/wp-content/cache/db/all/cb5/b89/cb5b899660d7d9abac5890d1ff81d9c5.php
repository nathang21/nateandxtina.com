We thought we could hike the Bright Angels trail down into the canyon but we were ill prepared - no hiking shoes or gear for the journey. Instead we stayed on top of the rim and took shuttles to each lookout (and even walked across to a few of the lookouts). We didn't realize how much there was to see up on the rim so we didn't even have time to hike. I'm a little bit afraid of heights and nearly had a heart attack when Nate wanted to take a picture off the ledge. A few other tourists encouraged me to go out on the ledge with him to snap a pic and they cheered when I made it back! I swear I wasn't crying in the photo below:

When we returned to our Airbnb, Nate had a quick nap to re-energize from the heat. Luckily for me, Nate drove to and from the Canyon so I was able to take a little nap in the car.&nbsp;

When we went to go out for dinner our Airbnb's hosts roommate asked if we were headed downtown. Why yes we are! He said he was going to call a cab to take him there but if we dropped him off he would get us a beer. Nate and I both said no you don't have to but we'll gladly let you ride with us! He showed us a cool brewery that only served Arizona beers. Lance (the roommate) did in fact get us a beer, what a guy! Nate ordered a coffee beer with caramel flavorings and I enjoyed it so much I ordered the same! He also showed us around the city a bit before meeting up with his friends.

For dinner we planned to head to a Thai place (came highly recommended by Lance) but when we went in the place was slammed with not a single table available, and closing in 30 minutes. Two blocks up the road was the same restaurant we had for dinner last night, the vegan place, Red Curry. We went ahead and ate there again! And I even ordered the same dish! Can't go wrong! I wish this place was in Orlando it was THAT good.&nbsp;

After our deja vu meal we went into a piano bar. This was not quite the same experience we had in Gainesville. This piano bar was very calm and played soft music. I stuck it safe and ordered a classic drink while Nate ordered a strange G&amp;T with mint that literally tasted like toothpaste. He persevered and drank the whole thing!

We then walked around downtown Flagstaff and visited a few shops. Nate and I bought two more matching bumper stickers that read "It's not too late" with an image of the Earth. Man does Nate love these stickers!&nbsp;

Our grand adventures from the day left us exhausted again so we called it a night to get a good nights rest for the journey to Nevada!&nbsp;";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"Stop 6 - Flagstaff 6/25/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:22:"stop-6-flagstaff-62516";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:48:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:48:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=351";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"6";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"376";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:51:48";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:51:48";s:12:"post_content";s:5292:"Once again we woke up to a fantastic breakfast, this time our hosts were awake as well and they cut us up fresh fruit and made us some tea before we headed off. We packed up, and hit the road towards Vegas.

Christina tried to drive first again, but with all the mountain-ness terrain that didn't last long. So I drove most the time, and we made it to Las Vegas in the afternoon.

On the way we made a pit stop at the Hoover Dam. We did the Power Plant Tour, walked and drove across the Dam, and went up top to a couple lookouts. We had an awesome time learning about this unbelievable engineering feat, even with modern technology.

Afterwards it was a quick 45 minuet drive left to Vegas. We checked into the New York New York hotel, and we were able to upgrade our room to the spa suite which we were estatic about.

We wanted to see a show, and bought tickets for later that night to see Cirque du Soleil Zumanity, which was conviently located on the first floor of our hotel.

We quickly checked out our room to drop off our bags, but then it was time to go out!

We went to dinner at IL Fornaio (Italian) in our hotel, and tried some wine flights along with gnocchi, veal, minestrone soup, and mottarella salad that the two of us shared.

Afterwards we went to the show, and enjoyed an amazing night of comedy, acrobatics, an orchestra, and beautiful signing.

Next up we did the rolar coaster on top of the hotel, and boarded from right inside. We met a few locals (at the ripe old age of 17) Hannah and her boyfriend who live in LV but had never done the coaster. We had fun getting to know them in line, and helped them get a BOGO on the tickets with our room keys. Of course we had to mention the website, so hopefully they made it here to see their shoutout! Best of luck to you both with Senior year (try not to take it too seriously ðŸ˜›)!

After this, it was time to finally explore the strip. Starting at one end from our hotel, we walked down taking everything in. We stopped to see the Bellagio fountain show, and went inside to check out the stunning lobby. Inside we stopped to cool off and relax with a drink and a zucchini pizza.

As we continued down, we walked into various lobbies of the nice hotels as we were bombarded with entertainment and ads.

After another long day, we decided the walk back wouldnt be too fun, so we grabbed a quick Uber home.

Once inside the NYNY, we got a couple drinks to bring back up to the room to relax and rest our feet.

The room had some amazing blackout curtains that we were not disturbed by the sun!

Outside of the NYNY was a famous breakfast spot called Bruxie. Famous for their chicken and waffles and came highly recommended by Nate's friends Kayla and Krishna. I ordered a Nutella, banana, and sweet cream waffle while Nate went a little healthier with the turkey pesto waffle.

Ready to get the day rolling we walked down to Excalibur which has big castles outsides. This hotel had an entire arcade on the bottom floor! We quickly poked our heads in here and went on our way to the Luxor. Another hotel with an amazing interior (Egyptian themed) and several shops.

We then took a quick Uber to Caesars Palace (it was way too hot to walk down)! We had planned to checkout the buffet for lunch but it was over an hour and a half wait. We headed over to the Chinese place right beside it and had some nice spicy beef with asparagus and ordered a vegetable lo mien.

Nate's mom recommended the indoor shopping mall in Caesars Palace and boy was she right! There were beautiful clouds painted all on the ceiling and many shopping places! Nate was a trooper while he stuck with me in my shopping adventure (the beer at lunch may have made him a little more relaxed)!

After the shopping we took another Uber back to the NYNY to get ready for dinner. We made reservations at the Bellagio Prime Steakhouse.

Just enough time to play a few rounds of Blackjack! I've never gambled before and I think Nate created a monster. We doubled our money from $50 to $112! We quit while we were ahead and made our way to the steakhouse.

While waiting to get seated we met a lovely couple from Destin, FL when we swapped taking pictures for one another. The man was in the Air Force and the woman was a PA. They congratulated Nate and I on our graduation, road trip, and new jobs. They were very excited for our future and bought us a round of drinks while we all waited to get seated (of course we ordered G&amp;Ts). Nate and I were again very fortunate to meet such kind people on our journey.

Wonderful fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, filet mignon, lobster tail, truffle mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. Couldn't have asked for a better last meal in Vegas!

Post dinner we had tickets to see Dillion Frances at the nightclub XS at the Encore hotel. The clubs here are VERY different from Orlando. For one the drinks were over $15 (way too expensive we only ordered one)! There was even a swimming pool in the patio of the club! Nate and I met a few people that were pretty impressed with Nate's shuffling skills - I need to catch up with his mighty dance talent. The club was open until 6:00am but there was no way Nate and I could stay out that late. We left a little before 2:00 to head back to the NYNY.

When getting back to our hotel I convinced Nate to play a few more rounds of Blackjack (what did I say? Nate created a monster!) We turned our money into $152! Not bad making $100 from our original $50! I would've kept going but lucky for me Nate pulled me away and kept me in check before we were back to zero.

On our way out we did the self checkout, grabbed the car and hit the road to Anaheim.

After 4 hours we were 10 minuets from the Airbnb, but starving nonetheless so we stopped at In n Out Burger. It had been a long time since I had it, and Christina had never experienced it. We enjoyed this quick delicious bite (caved - first time this whole trip cheating and getting fast food).

Our host informed us he would not be there when we arrived, but left us instructions. We went in, dropped off our bags and immediately requested the Uber to Disneyland. Five dollars and a less then ten minuet ride, we were entering the park.

I hadn't been in quite a few years, and once again this was all new for Christina. We had fun riding all the things that Disney World doesn't offer.

While in line for Finding Nemo (previously 20,000 leagues under the sea) we met a very cool family in line. Shout out to Marshal, Peggy, Claire, and Jamie. We each talked about the vacations we had planned, and things we've done so far. Peggy was from New Orleans, and we talked a lot about that, and our experiences driving across the country. They were traveling to California looking at schools for Claire the soccer star. She is about to be a senior and is deciding on where to go. All in all our party size went from 2 to 6 by the time we got to the front of the line. Hope they made it here okay (maybe we'll still have to mail Peggy a scrapbook).

We had a small snack for breakfast then hit the road North to Valencia. We stopped at Chipolte for a quick lunch with Mrs. Kahovec, a family friend whom I hadn't seen in over 10 years. It waa so great catching up with you, hopefully we can do it again soon but with the whole family!

From here, we got suggestions on directions for a more scenic route. After I-10 across most the country, we weren't looking for a boring drive. So we went towards the coast and took Highway 101 all the way North to Los Gatos. We originally wanted to break off further to highway 1 and ride the coast all the way up, but it was getting late and this would have added at least a couple hours to our trip. Next time.

Eventually after some wrong turns and confusion, we made it up the mountain to my Uncles Greg's, Aunt Patty, and cousins Ian and Colin house. We set our stuff down and headed out to dinner.

We went to a nice seafood place on Boardwalk Beach in Santa Cruz. Afterwards we walked next store for some caramel apples.

Unfortunately though there was someone in the shower slowing down our getting ready process. This was the first Airbnb we experienced that there was also a second room being rented out and we all shared one bathroom. Sharing the space wasn't too bad-except for when we're trying to jet outta the house real quick.

Once we finally showered we jumped in an Uber to head to the park! Our first fast pass was for the new ride in Cars Land - Radiator Springs Racers for later in the morning. While we waited for the fast pass time slot I went to get my face painted (again)!Â <a href="https://www.nateandxtina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_6877.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-495" title="" src="https://www.nateandxtina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_6877.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /></a>We were able to do all of the rides Nate and I had on our list: California Screaming, an Ariel ride, the swing set, the ferris wheel, and Nate's favorite-the Grizzly.

We decided against it as we had a big day again of driving. I was surprised in one of the shops when Nate offered to buy me a small gift to celebrate our time here at Disney. This lucky girl got a pair of Mickey Mouse stud earrings - a big thank you to my wonderful partner for the Disney surprise.

We quickly did two loads of laundry to get ready for our next and final destination (San Jose to Aunt Sandy's/Nate's new home)! The laundry never ended on this trip!

Nate's cousins Ian and Collin took us down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. I almost had a heart attack when Ian drove us down the mountain they live on. Before getting to the boardwalk we stopped and had lunch at this deli that had a large selection of fresh sandwiches, and a nice coconut latte.

At the boardwalk we rode the Fireball, Giant Dipper, and the air gliders across the boardwalk. The Fireball was a terrifying ride that was in the shape of a claw that spun you around and titled you up and down. It put the fair rides at the rodeo in Osceola County to shame. The Giant Dipper was an old wooden rollercoaster that jolted you around but was so much fun!

We finished some laundry and continued to enjoy everyone's company. Nathan's Uncle Greg made some burgers on the grill while his Aunt Patty made a salad for us to enjoy. It was a pre-July 4 BBQ celebration!

Nate's Aunt took us on a walk upon our arrival to Pinkberry on Santana Row. Nate and I both ordered the mango frozen yogurt with several fruit toppings. This was a nice treat from our long travels to finally get Nate to his new home! We chatted and enjoyed catching up with Nate's Aunt Patty and her partner Dave.

We made coffee, and enjoyed Sandy's famous green smoothies.</p>
After a quick hour drive, we parked at the famous Pier 39. We took some pictures, walked through Fishermans wharf, and down to Ghirardelli square. It was quite crowded but was great to see everything on foot. We grabbed a small hot cocoa from Ghirardelli as we called an Uber.

We took it to South San Francisco to meet up with Michael Deng and his wife Abby. It had been about 6 months, but we both worked with Michael at UCF in the College of Education Tech office. He had recently finished his graduate school and moved out here for a job.

They offered to cook us an authentic meal. Half was Korean BBQ, and the other half was Hot Pot (community broth where you cook meats, vegetables, etc. together and share family style). The thin cuts of beef we loved (and maybe filled up to much on), but the nice thing about Hot Pot is you slowly add stuff and eat it throughout the meal, which makes it easy to pace yourself. Everything they handed us was amazing, and it just kept coming. They were so nice to invite us over and provide this feast.

After lunch they dropped us off on their way out at Golden Gate Park. We walked around through the beautiful Park, but even with jackets us Floridans were freezing. We opted to get some coffee, and lay down in the park grass for awhile and enjoy the fresh air.

Next we took and Uber back to our car, and attempted to drive around. This was a big mistake as San Francisco is known for horrible traffic, and walking or public transportation is the way to go. We ended up getting stuck for an hour just trying to drive down the famous Lombard Street. After that we were tired and ready to head back.

We never made it to the bridge, but it was visible in the distance from a few of our shots. Next time we'll be more prepared, and as always we have a list of things to do.

We arrived at home just in time to catch Sandy and Dave leaving to get takeout, and we placed an order as well. They picked up some great salads and vegetable stir fry from Pasta Pomppadora just down the street in Santana Row.

We ate together, relaxed, and then decided on a movie to watch. Lately everyone had been asking me if I had seen "The Internship" and I figured before I start at Google I had to see it. It ended up being a pretty funny and obnoxious comedy, and made me wonder what Orientation will be like next Monday.

If only I could remember the name of this trail/town! Here's hoping Nate will chime in on the comment section and help me out here. Back to the smoothies - she prepared them with wonderful greens of kale, spinach, broccoli and several fruits and berries.

The hiking trail was fun and challenging for Nate and I who are extremely out of shape! Dave continued to tell us as we went up and up and up that the hike would get easier. I continued to wait the whole way up for the point at which it would be easier. There were beautiful redwood trees and the entire hike was shaded. It was very nice to spend our last day being outdoors and enjoying each other with Nate's family.

After we got home a shower was needed by all of us. Not only was the sweat bad, but our legs looked as if we had tights on from all the dirt! I then packed up all of my things that had exploded out of my bags into Nate's new bedroom. Packing up was filled with tears and laughs (tears by me - laughs by Nate as he made fun of me)!

Sandy planned a wonderful dinner (where we didn't get a photo! What was I thinking?! Probably too nervous having everyone there) with Nate's Uncle Greg, his cousins Ian and Colin, his second cousins Brett, and Brett's wife Amy. Nate and I helped prep and cook the asparagus for dinner. Sandy made a salad with lots of cut vegetables and a balsamic dressing. She had ordered chicken from a nearby place for take out that was again wonderful. Brett brought over apple pie and ice cream. It was a terrific dinner with superb company. Nate has such a beautiful family and I'm blessed they all welcomed me so warmly to California along with having Nate back for his new start at Google!

Once all the company left I did one last load of laundry to fly back with all clean clothes. While the laundry was running, we watched a movie with Sandy and Dave: Kate &amp; Leopold. A young Hugh Jackman in this "chick flick" movie that Nate even said he enjoyed! I fell asleep halfway through as I do with all movies. Instead of putting me to bed, Â Nate let me stay asleep on the couch for the rest of the movie as he knew I would refuse to get up anyway if everyone was still hanging out.

He finally did wake me up at the end of the movie, and then we packed all the clean laundry into my bags. After a few tears I managed to get to sleep to wake up early for my flight back to Orlando.";s:10:"post_title";s:25:"Stop 10 - San Jose 7/3/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"stop-10-san-jose-7316";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-06 01:08:50";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-06 01:08:50";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=633";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"4";}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"661";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2016-07-07 03:39:38";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-07 03:39:38";s:12:"post_content";s:1085:"This morning we woke early to cook some eggs for breakfast like old times.
