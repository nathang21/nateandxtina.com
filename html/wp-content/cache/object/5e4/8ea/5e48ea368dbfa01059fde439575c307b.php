If only I could remember the name of this trail/town! Here's hoping Nate will chime in on the comment section and help me out here. Back to the smoothies - she prepared them with wonderful greens of kale, spinach, broccoli and several fruits and berries.

The hiking trail was fun and challenging for Nate and I who are extremely out of shape! Dave continued to tell us as we went up and up and up that the hike would get easier. I continued to wait the whole way up for the point at which it would be easier. There were beautiful redwood trees and the entire hike was shaded. It was very nice to spend our last day being outdoors and enjoying each other with Nate's family.

After we got home a shower was needed by all of us. Not only was the sweat bad, but our legs looked as if we had tights on from all the dirt! I then packed up all of my things that had exploded out of my bags into Nate's new bedroom. Packing up was filled with tears and laughs (tears by me - laughs by Nate as he made fun of me)!

Sandy planned a wonderful dinner (where we didn't get a photo! What was I thinking?! Probably too nervous having everyone there) with Nate's Uncle Greg, his cousins Ian and Colin, his second cousins Brett, and Brett's wife Amy. Nate and I helped prep and cook the asparagus for dinner. Sandy made a salad with lots of cut vegetables and a balsamic dressing. She had ordered chicken from a nearby place for take out that was again wonderful. Brett brought over apple pie and ice cream. It was a terrific dinner with superb company. Nate has such a beautiful family and I'm blessed they all welcomed me so warmly to California along with having Nate back for his new start at Google!

Once all the company left I did one last load of laundry to fly back with all clean clothes. While the laundry was running, we watched a movie with Sandy and Dave: Kate &amp; Leopold. A young Hugh Jackman in this "chick flick" movie that Nate even said he enjoyed! I fell asleep halfway through as I do with all movies. Instead of putting me to bed, Â Nate let me stay asleep on the couch for the rest of the movie as he knew I would refuse to get up anyway if everyone was still hanging out.

He finally did wake me up at the end of the movie, and then we packed all the clean laundry into my bags. After a few tears I managed to get to sleep to wake up early for my flight back to Orlando.";s:10:"post_title";s:25:"Stop 10 - San Jose 7/3/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"stop-10-san-jose-7316";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-06 01:08:50";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-06 01:08:50";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=633";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"4";}}
