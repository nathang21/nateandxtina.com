Unfortunately though there was someone in the shower slowing down our getting ready process. This was the first Airbnb we experienced that there was also a second room being rented out and we all shared one bathroom. Sharing the space wasn't too bad-except for when we're trying to jet outta the house real quick.

Once we finally showered we jumped in an Uber to head to the park! Our first fast pass was for the new ride in Cars Land - Radiator Springs Racers for later in the morning. While we waited for the fast pass time slot I went to get my face painted (again)!Â <a href="https://www.nateandxtina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_6877.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-495" title="" src="https://www.nateandxtina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_6877.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /></a>We were able to do all of the rides Nate and I had on our list: California Screaming, an Ariel ride, the swing set, the ferris wheel, and Nate's favorite-the Grizzly. We also stopped by a wine tasting both ordered a flight. We may have ordered a margarita in there to rest our feet from all of the walking.

Nate and I enjoyed a bottle of wine with our dinner and had excellent service.

It was a wonderful water and light show that took you through the history of Walt, Mickey, and even showcased Frozen. I only cried twice during the show. This is a must see for any Disney fan!

We decided against it as we had a big day again of driving. I was surprised in one of the shops when Nate offered to buy me a small gift to celebrate our time here at Disney. This lucky girl got a pair of Mickey Mouse stud earrings - a big thank you to my wonderful partner for the Disney surprise.

We headed straight to home after our time in Downtown Disney to get sleep before our drive to see Nate's family in Los Gatos!";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"Stop 8 - Anaheim 6/29/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:20:"stop-8-anaheim-62916";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-02 22:59:01";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-02 22:59:01";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=503";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
