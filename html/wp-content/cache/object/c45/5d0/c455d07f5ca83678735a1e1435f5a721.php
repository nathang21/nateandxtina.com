We went to a breakfast buffet at the chinese place (but for lunch and dinner) called Chin Chin. We ordered customized omelets and enjoyed lots of fresh fruit.

On our way out we did the self checkout, grabbed the car and hit the road to Anaheim.

After 4 hours we were 10 minuets from the Airbnb, but starving nonetheless so we stopped at In n Out Burger. It had been a long time since I had it, and Christina had never experienced it. We enjoyed this quick delicious bite (caved - first time this whole trip cheating and getting fast food).

Our host informed us he would not be there when we arrived, but left us instructions. We went in, dropped off our bags and immediately requested the Uber to Disneyland. Five dollars and a less then ten minuet ride, we were entering the park.

I hadn't been in quite a few years, and once again this was all new for Christina. We had fun riding all the things that Disney World doesn't offer.

While in line for Finding Nemo (previously 20,000 leagues under the sea) we met a very cool family in line. Shout out to Marshal, Peggy, Claire, and Jamie. We each talked about the vacations we had planned, and things we've done so far. Peggy was from New Orleans, and we talked a lot about that, and our experiences driving across the country. They were traveling to California looking at schools for Claire the soccer star. She is about to be a senior and is deciding on where to go. All in all our party size went from 2 to 6 by the time we got to the front of the line. Hope they made it here okay (maybe we'll still have to mail Peggy a scrapbook).

After begging all day, we took a small break for Christina to get her face painted. This was everything she thought it would be and more.

We rode a few more rides and by about 10 left the park before the fireworks chaos, and grabbed some dinner at Downtown Disney.

After this half day at the park, we got an Uber home and crashed immediately. Time to do it again tomorrow at the other Park, except this time a full day!";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"â€‹Stop 8 - Anaheim 6/28/16Â ";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:29:"%e2%80%8bstop-8-anaheim-62816";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-06-29 23:37:29";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-06-29 23:37:29";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=455";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"7";}}
