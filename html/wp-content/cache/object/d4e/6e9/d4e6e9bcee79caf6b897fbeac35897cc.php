The room had some amazing blackout curtains that we were not disturbed by the sun!

Outside of the NYNY was a famous breakfast spot called Bruxie. Famous for their chicken and waffles and came highly recommended by Nate's friends Kayla and Krishna. I ordered a Nutella, banana, and sweet cream waffle while Nate went a little healthier with the turkey pesto waffle.

Ready to get the day rolling we walked down to Excalibur which has big castles outsides. This hotel had an entire arcade on the bottom floor! We quickly poked our heads in here and went on our way to the Luxor. Another hotel with an amazing interior (Egyptian themed) and several shops.

We then took a quick Uber to Caesars Palace (it was way too hot to walk down)! We had planned to checkout the buffet for lunch but it was over an hour and a half wait. We headed over to the Chinese place right beside it and had some nice spicy beef with asparagus and ordered a vegetable lo mien.

Nate's mom recommended the indoor shopping mall in Caesars Palace and boy was she right! There were beautiful clouds painted all on the ceiling and many shopping places! Nate was a trooper while he stuck with me in my shopping adventure (the beer at lunch may have made him a little more relaxed)!

After the shopping we took another Uber back to the NYNY to get ready for dinner. We made reservations at the Bellagio Prime Steakhouse.

Just enough time to play a few rounds of Blackjack! I've never gambled before and I think Nate created a monster. We doubled our money from $50 to $112! We quit while we were ahead and made our way to the steakhouse.

While waiting to get seated we met a lovely couple from Destin, FL when we swapped taking pictures for one another. The man was in the Air Force and the woman was a PA. They congratulated Nate and I on our graduation, road trip, and new jobs. They were very excited for our future and bought us a round of drinks while we all waited to get seated (of course we ordered G&amp;Ts). Nate and I were again very fortunate to meet such kind people on our journey.

Wonderful fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, filet mignon, lobster tail, truffle mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. Couldn't have asked for a better last meal in Vegas!

Post dinner we had tickets to see Dillion Frances at the nightclub XS at the Encore hotel. The clubs here are VERY different from Orlando. For one the drinks were over $15 (way too expensive we only ordered one)! There was even a swimming pool in the patio of the club! Nate and I met a few people that were pretty impressed with Nate's shuffling skills - I need to catch up with his mighty dance talent. The club was open until 6:00am but there was no way Nate and I could stay out that late. We left a little before 2:00 to head back to the NYNY.

When getting back to our hotel I convinced Nate to play a few more rounds of Blackjack (what did I say? Nate created a monster!) We turned our money into $152! Not bad making $100 from our original $50! I would've kept going but lucky for me Nate pulled me away and kept me in check before we were back to zero.

We grabbed a quick hot tea from the Starbucks in the lobby (note, there is a Starbucks in ever single hotel, or two) to soothe our throats. Back up to the room to get a good nights sleep before our next adventure to DisneyLAND!";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"ï»¿Stop 7 - Las Vegas 6/27/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"%ef%bb%bfstop-7-las-vegas-62716";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-06-29 20:34:59";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-06-29 20:34:59";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=432";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"4";}}
