We thought we could hike the Bright Angels trail down into the canyon but we were ill prepared - no hiking shoes or gear for the journey. Instead we stayed on top of the rim and took shuttles to each lookout (and even walked across to a few of the lookouts). We didn't realize how much there was to see up on the rim so we didn't even have time to hike. I'm a little bit afraid of heights and nearly had a heart attack when Nate wanted to take a picture off the ledge. A few other tourists encouraged me to go out on the ledge with him to snap a pic and they cheered when I made it back! I swear I wasn't crying in the photo below:

When we returned to our Airbnb, Nate had a quick nap to re-energize from the heat. Luckily for me, Nate drove to and from the Canyon so I was able to take a little nap in the car.&nbsp;

When we went to go out for dinner our Airbnb's hosts roommate asked if we were headed downtown. Why yes we are! He said he was going to call a cab to take him there but if we dropped him off he would get us a beer. Nate and I both said no you don't have to but we'll gladly let you ride with us! He showed us a cool brewery that only served Arizona beers. Lance (the roommate) did in fact get us a beer, what a guy! Nate ordered a coffee beer with caramel flavorings and I enjoyed it so much I ordered the same! He also showed us around the city a bit before meeting up with his friends.

For dinner we planned to head to a Thai place (came highly recommended by Lance) but when we went in the place was slammed with not a single table available, and closing in 30 minutes. Two blocks up the road was the same restaurant we had for dinner last night, the vegan place, Red Curry. We went ahead and ate there again! And I even ordered the same dish! Can't go wrong! I wish this place was in Orlando it was THAT good.&nbsp;

After our deja vu meal we went into a piano bar. This was not quite the same experience we had in Gainesville. This piano bar was very calm and played soft music. I stuck it safe and ordered a classic drink while Nate ordered a strange G&amp;T with mint that literally tasted like toothpaste. He persevered and drank the whole thing!

We then walked around downtown Flagstaff and visited a few shops. Nate and I bought two more matching bumper stickers that read "It's not too late" with an image of the Earth. Man does Nate love these stickers!&nbsp;

Our grand adventures from the day left us exhausted again so we called it a night to get a good nights rest for the journey to Nevada!&nbsp;";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"Stop 6 - Flagstaff 6/25/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:22:"stop-6-flagstaff-62516";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:48:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-06-29 03:48:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=351";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"6";}}
