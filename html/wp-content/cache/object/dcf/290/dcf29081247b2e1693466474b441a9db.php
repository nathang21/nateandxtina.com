We packed up, left the key, and checked out of our Airbnb. Our host Aman who we never formally metmet, was great at communicating and being flexible with our schedules even while at work.

We had a small snack for breakfast then hit the road North to Valencia. We stopped at Chipolte for a quick lunch with Mrs. Kahovec, a family friend whom I hadn't seen in over 10 years. It waa so great catching up with you, hopefully we can do it again soon but with the whole family!

From here, we got suggestions on directions for a more scenic route. After I-10 across most the country, we weren't looking for a boring drive. So we went towards the coast and took Highway 101 all the way North to Los Gatos. We originally wanted to break off further to highway 1 and ride the coast all the way up, but it was getting late and this would have added at least a couple hours to our trip. Next time.

Eventually after some wrong turns and confusion, we made it up the mountain to my Uncles Greg's, Aunt Patty, and cousins Ian and Colin house. We set our stuff down and headed out to dinner.

We went to a nice seafood place on Boardwalk Beach in Santa Cruz. Afterwards we walked next store for some caramel apples.

Finally we headed back up to the house and relaxed for awhile till everyone crashed.";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"â€‹Stop 9 - Los Gatos 6/30/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"%e2%80%8bstop-9-los-gatos-63016";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-02 22:57:12";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-02 22:57:12";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=492";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"1";}}
