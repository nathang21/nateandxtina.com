We made coffee, and enjoyed Sandy's famous green smoothies.</p>
After a quick hour drive, we parked at the famous Pier 39. We took some pictures, walked through Fishermans wharf, and down to Ghirardelli square. It was quite crowded but was great to see everything on foot. We grabbed a small hot cocoa from Ghirardelli as we called an Uber.

We took it to South San Francisco to meet up with Michael Deng and his wife Abby. It had been about 6 months, but we both worked with Michael at UCF in the College of Education Tech office. He had recently finished his graduate school and moved out here for a job.

They offered to cook us an authentic meal. Half was Korean BBQ, and the other half was Hot Pot (community broth where you cook meats, vegetables, etc. together and share family style). The thin cuts of beef we loved (and maybe filled up to much on), but the nice thing about Hot Pot is you slowly add stuff and eat it throughout the meal, which makes it easy to pace yourself. Everything they handed us was amazing, and it just kept coming. They were so nice to invite us over and provide this feast.

After lunch they dropped us off on their way out at Golden Gate Park. We walked around through the beautiful Park, but even with jackets us Floridans were freezing. We opted to get some coffee, and lay down in the park grass for awhile and enjoy the fresh air.

Next we took and Uber back to our car, and attempted to drive around. This was a big mistake as San Francisco is known for horrible traffic, and walking or public transportation is the way to go. We ended up getting stuck for an hour just trying to drive down the famous Lombard Street. After that we were tired and ready to head back.

We never made it to the bridge, but it was visible in the distance from a few of our shots. Next time we'll be more prepared, and as always we have a list of things to do.

We arrived at home just in time to catch Sandy and Dave leaving to get takeout, and we placed an order as well. They picked up some great salads and vegetable stir fry from Pasta Pomppadora just down the street in Santana Row.

We ate together, relaxed, and then decided on a movie to watch. Lately everyone had been asking me if I had seen "The Internship" and I figured before I start at Google I had to see it. It ended up being a pretty funny and obnoxious comedy, and made me wonder what Orientation will be like next Monday.
