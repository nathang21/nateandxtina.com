They are currently renovating their kitchen but we still managed to have a nice breakfast. I'm looking forward to seeing their kitchen once it's all set up!

We quickly did two loads of laundry to get ready for our next and final destination (San Jose to Aunt Sandy's/Nate's new home)! The laundry never ended on this trip!

Nate's cousins Ian and Collin took us down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. I almost had a heart attack when Ian drove us down the mountain they live on. Before getting to the boardwalk we stopped and had lunch at this deli that had a large selection of fresh sandwiches, and a nice coconut latte.

At the boardwalk we rode the Fireball, Giant Dipper, and the air gliders across the boardwalk. The Fireball was a terrifying ride that was in the shape of a claw that spun you around and titled you up and down. It put the fair rides at the rodeo in Osceola County to shame. The Giant Dipper was an old wooden rollercoaster that jolted you around but was so much fun!

We finished some laundry and continued to enjoy everyone's company. Nathan's Uncle Greg made some burgers on the grill while his Aunt Patty made a salad for us to enjoy. It was a pre-July 4 BBQ celebration!

Nate's Aunt took us on a walk upon our arrival to Pinkberry on Santana Row. Nate and I both ordered the mango frozen yogurt with several fruit toppings. This was a nice treat from our long travels to finally get Nate to his new home! We chatted and enjoyed catching up with Nate's Aunt Patty and her partner Dave.

After the long day of rides, walks, and good times we settled into bed to get up for our journey to San Francisco the next day.";s:10:"post_title";s:25:"Stop 9 - Los Gatos 7/1/16";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"stop-9-los-gatos-7116";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-04 18:23:08";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-04 18:23:08";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://www.nateandxtina.com/?p=566";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"8";}}
