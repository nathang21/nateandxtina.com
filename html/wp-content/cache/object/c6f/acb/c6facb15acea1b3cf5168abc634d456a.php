We packed up, and hit the road towards Vegas.

Christina tried to drive first again, but with all the mountain-ness terrain that didn't last long. So I drove most the time, and we made it to Las Vegas in the afternoon.

On the way we made a pit stop at the Hoover Dam. We did the Power Plant Tour, walked and drove across the Dam, and went up top to a couple lookouts. We had an awesome time learning about this unbelievable engineering feat, even with modern technology.

Afterwards it was a quick 45 minuet drive left to Vegas. We checked into the New York New York hotel, and we were able to upgrade our room to the spa suite which we were estatic about.

We wanted to see a show, and bought tickets for later that night to see Cirque du Soleil Zumanity, which was conviently located on the first floor of our hotel.

We quickly checked out our room to drop off our bags, but then it was time to go out!

We went to dinner at IL Fornaio (Italian) in our hotel, and tried some wine flights along with gnocchi, veal, minestrone soup, and mottarella salad that the two of us shared.

Afterwards we went to the show, and enjoyed an amazing night of comedy, acrobatics, an orchestra, and beautiful signing.

Next up we did the rolar coaster on top of the hotel, and boarded from right inside. We met a few locals (at the ripe old age of 17) Hannah and her boyfriend who live in LV but had never done the coaster. We had fun getting to know them in line, and helped them get a BOGO on the tickets with our room keys. Of course we had to mention the website, so hopefully they made it here to see their shoutout! Best of luck to you both with Senior year (try not to take it too seriously ðŸ˜›)!

After this, it was time to finally explore the strip. Starting at one end from our hotel, we walked down taking everything in. We stopped to see the Bellagio fountain show, and went inside to check out the stunning lobby. Inside we stopped to cool off and relax with a drink and a zucchini pizza.

As we continued down, we walked into various lobbies of the nice hotels as we were bombarded with entertainment and ads.

After another long day, we decided the walk back wouldnt be too fun, so we grabbed a quick Uber home.

Once inside the NYNY, we got a couple drinks to bring back up to the room to relax and rest our feet.
